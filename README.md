Choccy chips is a single .js file that allows you to
easily use .json files for your cookies, allowing
for higher-detail user data.

## How to use
Simply add the choccy-chips folder into your project, and 
you won't have to worry __at all__ about the licensing, because 
it pretty much doesn't exist. All you have to do is 
keep the info.txt file, and edit it appropriately.

## Why use Choccy Chips?
It is easy. There is no other reason, really. Why create
your own solution when the solution is *right* here?

# Is Choccy Chips easily extensible?
Of course! The info.txt file does not prohibit modifications,
and adding anything related to your cookie solving is allowed.
